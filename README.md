Agro Smart - A Smart Agriculture Automation System
Agro Smart is a next-generation AI and IoT-based system designed to transform traditional agriculture through automation, real-time data analytics, and intelligent decision-making. The platform provides seamless automation for irrigation, soil and weather monitoring, fertilizer management, and precision farming—empowering farmers, gardeners, and agri-tech users to boost crop yields while conserving water and resources.

🧠 Project Vision
With climate change, water scarcity, and unpredictable weather conditions affecting agriculture, there's a growing need for smart, data-driven solutions. Agro Smart aims to bridge this gap by integrating sensors, controllers, and intelligent software into a unified system. Whether you're growing crops on a small terrace garden or managing a large agricultural field, Agro Smart brings innovation and intelligence to your fingertips.
